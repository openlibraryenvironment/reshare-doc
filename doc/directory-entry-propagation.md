## Introduction

The ReShare project aims to allow libraries to perform inter-library loans with members of other libraries that are in the same consortium as them; and potentially in other consortia. To support this, it is necessary to furnish a directory of the available candidate lending sources, containing information about what protocols they support, how much they charge, etc. The beginnings of support for this directory are provided by the server-side module [`mod-directory`](https://github.com/openlibraryenvironment/mod-directory) and its client-side counterpart [`ui-directory`](https://github.com/openlibraryenvironment/ui-directory).

The directory must be available to all nodes in a ReShare network, in a reasonably up-to-date form. There are several possible ways to achieve this goal, varying in elegance, efficiency and development effort. In this document, we will survey some possible solutions, and try to determine a realistic path to an ideal arrangement.
